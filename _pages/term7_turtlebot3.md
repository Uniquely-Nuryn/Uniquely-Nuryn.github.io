### Project Overview and Tasks
This project, which was part of our Intelligent Robotics course, required us to use to work in teams of 4 to programme a pre-assesmbled TurtleBot3 robot. Our task was to programme the robot to navigate through a given maze at the back of our classroom and achieve the following outcomes:

1. Map the maze with **manual waypoints** using Nav2 + SLAM;
2. Map the maze **autonomously** using Frontier Based Exploration;
3. Use **image recognition** to count number of items seen plus stop autonomously upon seeing the 'STOP' sign.

We were advised to use ROS 2 (Humble) as Ubuntu 22.04 has been pre-installed for us on the shared Legion laptop that our team received.
