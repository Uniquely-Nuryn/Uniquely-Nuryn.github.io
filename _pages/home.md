Hello and welcome to my personal portfolio ðŸ˜Š 

I am a recent graduate from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) with a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Product Development (EPD).
    
My educational background is rooted in STEM, and I have taken a broad range of technical courses like Topics in Biomedical and Healthcare Engineering; Science of Sound; Systems and Control; and Digital Signal Processing at SUTD. Throughout my time in SUTD, I also worked on numerous group projects â€” a few of my favourites are curated in the <a href="publications.html">SUTD Projects</a> section.

That aside, I am also passionate about health and wellness, mindful living, caring for the environment and personal growth. In my pastime, I enjoy exercising, reading, ballet, and art. You can find some of my personal artwork in the <a href="art-gallery.html">Art</a> section of this site.
