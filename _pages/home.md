I am a final year undergraduate student in the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I am pursuing a Bachelor in Engineering Product Development (EPD), with a specialisation in Robotics.

As someone who is pursuing STEM and also a creative soul, I'm keen on exploring the fusion of STEM with artistry. I'm driven by a constant desire to learn, develop my skills and find my niche while seeking opportunities that support my personal and professional growth. 

Outside of my work, I enjoy doing art, ballet and exercising. If I find a good book, then reading is also included.
