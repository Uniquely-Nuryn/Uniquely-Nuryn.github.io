In this page, you can find a compilation of some of the individual/collaborative projects I did over the semesters, or more correctly <i>terms</i>, in SUTD. In SUTD, projects are part of our core modules for each term.

I have written short blog posts for my projects, where I share briefly about my experiences and what I have learnt through these projects. The links are listed below (in reverse chronological order):
