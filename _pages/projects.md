In this page, you can find a compilation of some of the individual/collaborative projects I worked on in SUTD. The project-based curriculum in SUTD has allowed me to work and collaborate with many different bright people, explore various interests and develop both technical and soft skills.

I have written short blog posts for these projects, where I briefly share about my experiences, contributions and what I have learnt through these projects. The links are listed below (in reverse chronological order):
