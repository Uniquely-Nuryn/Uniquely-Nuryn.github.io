<h1 class="mt-4">SUTD Projects</h1> 
<div class="container" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
In this page, you will find a compilation of selected group projects I have worked on in SUTD. The project-based curriculum in SUTD has allowed me to collaboratively work with many different bright people, explore various interests and develop both my technical and soft skills.

I have written short blog posts for these projects, where I briefly share about my experiences, contributions and what I have learnt through these projects. The projects are listed below (in reverse chronological order):
