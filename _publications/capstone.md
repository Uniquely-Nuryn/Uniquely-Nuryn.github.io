description: Our team worked with Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) to develop an integrated VR-based system for drug abusers undergoing cognitive-behavioural therapy in Singapore.

## 1. Project Significance
At present, drug abusers in Singapore Prison Services (SPS) undergo VR-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) as part of their addiction recovery. During each session, virtual scenarios are shown to them to simulate situations of drug temptation. Their heart rate and eye gaze dwell time are also monitored, allowing counsellors or psychologists to infer the emotional state of the drug abuser.

## 2. Pain Points Identified 
1. **Limited Emotional Analysis**: Relies only on raw data of heart rate & eye gaze dwell time
2. **Difficulty in Inferring Emotions**: Counsellors or psychologists have difficulty inferring the drug abuserâ€™s emotions from the raw sensor signals.
3. **Linear and Static VR**: The current VR scenes, which were developed on Unreal Engine 5 (UE5.4), were lacked realism and responsiveness.

## 3. Development Process
Our team of 6, comprising students from computer science, product engineering, and architecture, divided responsibilities across 3 segments:
- **AI development**
- **Hardware (sensors)**
- **VR scene enhancement in UE5.4**

## 4. My Main Contributions
I focused on the **VR scene enhancement in UE5.4**, supporting the creation of nine animated 3D scenes that simulate peer pressure in drug-related scenarios. These scenes used MetaHuman characters and motion-captured animations, and were then integrated with HTX's legacy content to enhance realism for more effective therapy.
