## 1. About this Project
This project required us to design our own experiment/test to evaluate a **material property** of Nitinol (NiTi) for any specific application. We were only given an 8cm NiTi wire to test on, so we had to be creative and think outside the box on how to do the test.

My chosen topic was using NiTi in orthopaedic devices, specifically **High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) plates**, which are used for providing knee stability in bowlegged patients after realignment surgery. To elaborate, HTO surgery involves cutting the tibial bone and re-aligning it so that the leg is *less* bowlegged, then using a HTO plate to hold the tibia in place so that the separate tibial bones can heal and fuse back together.


HTO plates are typically made of **rigid** Titanium. The good side is it provides stability, but the downside is that it is acts as a permanent fixture during healing. However, studies suggest that varying the fixation stiffness at different stages of the recovery period can accelerate recovery time and also reduce complications. Current methods to modify fixation stiffness include removing the bolts and screws via a separate surgical procedure which is invasive and, hence, not very desirable. 

So for this project, I investigated the plausibility of a non-invasive method, transcutaneous heating, to vary the fixation/compressive stiffness **(Modulus of elasticity, E)** of NiTi. 

## 2. Development Process

To investigate the plausibility, I conducted 2 tests: 
- 3-point bend test and gripping approach
    - **Reason**: To verify that *E (minimum for a HTO plate) ≤ E (NiTi-enhanced plate) ≤ E (Titanium)* 

- Resistive heating of the NiTi wire by passing current through it 
    - **Reason**: To verify that heating NiTi would actually vary its stiffness, and if so, that the temperature is within a safe range for transcutaneous heating

## 3. Takeaways

1. Experimental results showed that the stiffness of an 8cm NiTi wire (0.254mm diameter, 50-50 composition) with resistive heating of 2.31A current is **57.6 GPa**. This corroborates with existing studies. 

2. Raising the temperature of the NiTi wire should theoretically increase the wire's compressive stiffness and, consequently, its modulus of elasticity, E. However, due to mistakenly increasing the voltage instead of the current, this meant that the experiments were all done at the same temperature. Due to time constraints to repeat the experiments, there was insufficient data to evaluate the effect(s) of temperature on the stiffness of the NiTi wire and thus its suitability for HTO implants.
