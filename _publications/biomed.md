## 1. About this Project
For this design project, we were required to develop an optimised end-to-end digital workflow for the mass customisation of insoles for *Singapore General Hospital (SGH)*. My group selected patients with stage 0 diabetic foot as our target group.

 Early diagnosis of diabetic foot condition and wearing suitable customised insoles at stage 0 can help to redistribute high pressure areas that lead to ulcers, thereby preventing aggravation into later stages.

## 2. Main Contributions
- Foot scanning using a handheld 3D scanner (photogrammetry technology)
- Research on existing workflows for the mass production of insoles.
- Research on optimisation strategies for the mass production of insoles. One approach was **Topological Optimisation**, which:
    - considers the distribution of material within a defined design space​
    - aims to find the optimal material layout by iteratively removing material from non-critical areas and redistributing it to critical load-bearing regions​​

## 3. Development Process
After weeks of planning, discussion and product development, our team proposed a streamlined digital workflow that consists of 3D scanning, mesh editing of the scanned foot (CAD file) using Rhino software, and 3D printing. We estimated our entire workflow to take only less than 1 week, and potentially makes insoles more affordable since minimal materials are required, aside from the initial investment in a good computer, 3D printer and the filament.

Our key innovation was in the mesh editing using Rhino, where my teammate Yuchuan used Grasshopper (visual programming plugin) to develop a script that simplifies the insole design process and enables customisable topology within **1-2 min**. ***(See video below)***

## 4. Takeaways 
This design project highlighted the relevance of 3D modelling and printing in the biomedical field of orthotics, particularly to streamline/digitise the existing insole mass production workflow which is still very manual. I learnt that an improved digitised workflow is potentially beneficial as it can shorten the production time and also reduce costs as customised insoles are typically expensive. While I focused more on the research rather than the product development aspect of the project, I believe that each role meaningfully contributed to the overall sucess of our project.
