<p>Hello and welcome to my personal portfolio ðŸ˜Š </p> 

    <p>I am a recent graduate from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) with a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Product Development (EPD). </p>
    
    My educational background is rooted in STEM, and I have taken a broad range of technical courses like Topics in Biomedical and Healthcare Engineering; Science of Sound; Systems and Control; and Digital Signal Processing at SUTD. Throughout my time in SUTD, I also worked on numerous group projects â€” a few of my favourites are curated in the <a href="{{ '/sutd-projects/' | relative_url }}">SUTD Projects</a> section.</p>
    <p>That aside, I am also passionate about personal growth ðŸŒ±. Some of my favourite things are doing mindful exercise, reading, ballet, art and most of all learning something new each dayðŸ’¡. You can find some of my personal artwork in the <a href="{{ '/art-gallery/' | relative_url }}">Art</a> section.</p>
