<p>Hello and welcome to my personal portfolio ✨  </p> 

    <p>I am a recent graduate from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) with a Bachelor's degree (honours) in Engineering Product Development (EPD). </p>
    
    My educational background is rooted in STEM, and I have taken a broad range of technical courses like Topics in Biomedical and Healthcare Engineering; Science of Sound; Systems and Control; and Digital Signal Processing at SUTD. Throughout my time in SUTD, I also worked on numerous group projects — a few of my favourites are curated in the <a href="{{ '/sutd-projects/' | relative_url }}">SUTD Projects</a> section.</p>
    <p>Outside of my studies, I love finding ways to grow and challenge myself. I enjoy staying physically active through long-distance running, ice skating, and ballet - which I am currently focusing on most. Do check out some of my personal artwork in the <a href="{{ '/art-gallery-new/' | relative_url }}">Art</a> section.</p>
